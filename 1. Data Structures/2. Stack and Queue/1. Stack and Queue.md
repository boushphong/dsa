# Stacks

**Stack** is an abstract data type - and it can be implemented either with an **Array** or with a **Linked List**.
  - LIFO structure - the last item we inserted is the first item we take out
  - Basic operations are `pop()`, `push()` and `peek()`.

Most of the modern programming languages are stack-oriented
  - They define most basic operations (adding two numbers) as taking their arguments from the stack and placing any return values back on the stack

## LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Pop: remove the last item
- Push: insert a new item into the stack
- Peek: show the last item

## Stack Applications
- In stack-oriented programming languages:
  - Graph algorithms rely heavily on stacks such as depth-first search can be implemented with stacks.
  - Finding Eulerian cycles in a G(V,E) graph.
  - Finding strongly connected components in a given G(V,E) graph.

## Memory Management

There are 2 main types of memory: **Stack** memor and Heap memory

**Stack Memory**
- The **Stack** memory is a special region in the **RAM**.
- This is a special data type that store the active functions and local variables as well.
- This is how Python knows wehre to return after finishing execution of a given function.

**Heap Memory**
- The **Heap** memory is a special region in the **RAM**.
- The size of the heap memory is way larger than that of the stack memory. Thus, more items can be stored.
- Objects are stored on the **Heap** memory.

**Comparisions**

| Characteristic    | Stack                                      | Heap                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Size**          | Small                                      | Large                                     |
| **Access Speed**  | Fast                                       | Slow                                      |
| **Contents**      | Function calls, local variables            | Objects                                   |
| **Fragmentation** | No fragmentation                           | May become fragmented                     |


### Stack and Heap

When **func3** finished, there is no longer a reference to the object House. Therefore, the House object will be eligible for **garbage collection**. Thus, will be removed from the Heap memory. Everytime, a function finished and there was no longer any object referencing to the function. Then, the function will be removed from the stack memory

# Queue

**Queue** is an abstract data type - and it can be implemented either with an **Array** or with a **Linked List**.
  - FIFO structure - the first item we inserted is the first item we take out.
  - Basic operations are `enqueue()`, `dequeue()` and `peek()`.
  - Has several applications in operating systems and thread management (multithreading).

## Applications

**Queues** are useful when a resource is shared with several consumers (for example threads).
- Threads are stored in **Queues**.
- **Queues** are important in CPU scheduling.
- When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. **Queues** can be employed as an intermediary or a buffer between these two processes. Instead of having the processes directly communicate with each other, they can interact through a queue.
- **Graph** algorithms rely heavily on **Queues**
- **Breadth-First Search** use **Queue** as an underlying abstract data type.
