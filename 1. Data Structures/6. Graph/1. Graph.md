# Graph

```
     A---B       A, B, C, D are Nodes (Vertices)
    /    |       Between Vertices, there may be a Edge (connection)
   /     |       Eg: Vertex A connects to 2 Vertices (B and C)
  C------D
```

## Weighted Graph
In a graph, there might be weighted edges
Applications: Google Maps, Network Routing Protocal
```
      A
     / \
   2/   \3
   /     \
  B---4---C
```

## Bidirectional
```
B-------C     Same as     B<----->C
```
Example: Friends on Facebook

## Directional
```
You------>Celeb
```
Example: You follow a celebrity on Instagram

**NOTE:** Edges can be weighted or non-weighted, directional or bi-directional

**Linked Lists** are a form of a **Tree**, and a **Tree** is a form of a **Graph**. Hence **Linked Lists** are a form of a **Graph**.
## Basic concepts: Degree, Adjacency, Path, Cycle

- Consider an edge `e = (u, v)`. We say u and v are two adjacent vertices.
- In a directed graph, the `outdegree` of vertex u is the number of edges emanating from u. The `indegree` of vertex u is the number of edges entering u. The `degree` of u is the number of edges connected to u.
- A sequence of vertices `(u1, ..., uk)` such that `(u_i - 1, u_i)` belongs to `E` is called a `path` in the graph. A path that starts and ends at the same vertex is called a `cycle`.

{
     A: [(B, 2), (C, 3)]
     B: [(A, 2), (D, 1)]

```
**Summary:** The adjacency matrix is a matrix where each row and column represents a vertex in the graph, and the entries in the matrix indicate whether there is an edge between two vertices. If there is an edge between vertices i and j, then the i-th row and j-th column entry in the matrix is 1. If there is no edge between vertices i and j, then the i-th row and j-th column entry is 0. This representation is particularly useful when the graph is dense, i.e., when there are many edges.

On the other hand, the adjacency list is a list of lists, where each list represents the neighbors of a vertex. Each entry in the list consists of a pair of the neighboring vertex and the weight of the corresponding edge. This representation is particularly useful when the graph is sparse, i.e., when there are few edges, because it does not require storing as much data as the adjacency matrix.

Both representations have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of representation depends on the specific problem being solved and the requirements of the algorithm or application.

     D: [B, C]                Removing an Edge (F) would require iterating through Vertex F's list of Edges. 
     F: [B]                   Then remove Edge B, and then iterating through Vertex's B and then remove Edge F.
