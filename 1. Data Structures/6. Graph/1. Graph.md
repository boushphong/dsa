# Graph

```
     A---B       A, B, C, D are Nodes (Vertices)
    /    |       Between Vertices, there may be a Edge (connection)
   /     |       Eg: Vertex A connects to 2 Vertices (B and C)
  C------D
```

## Weighted Graph
In a graph, there might be weighted edges
Applications: Google Maps, Network Routing Protocal
```
      A
     / \
   2/   \3
   /     \
  B---4---C
```

## Bidirectional
```
B-------C     Same as     B<----->C
```
Example: Friends on Facebook

## Directional
```
You------>Celeb
```
Example: You follow a celebrity on Instagram

**NOTE:** Edges can be weighted or non-weighted, directional or bi-directional
