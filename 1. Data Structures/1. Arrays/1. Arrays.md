# Data Structures

## Arrays and Lists
- All items in an array is identified by an index - an integer starting with 0
- Fast operations for inserting new items or removing items from the data structure
- The items of the array are located right next to each other in the main memory (RAM) - They can be accessed by the index

Memory address of each item in the array is stored next to each other.

## Complexity

### Manipulation
- **Adding items:** We can insert new items at the end of the data structure until the data structure is not full - **O(1)** running time.
- In case the array becomes full:
  - Have to allocate a larger chunk of memory in the RAM (usually twice the size of the actual array)
  - Have to copy the existing items one by one to the new array - **O(N)** running time

**Advantages:**
- Random Access: We can access arbitrary items fast with indexes

**Disadvantages:**
- Not a dynamic data structure, we have to know the number of items we want to store at **compile-time**.
  - Whenever an array is full, we have to rezize it in **O(N)** running time
- Usually we cannot store items with diferent types in an array - Python is an Exception.
