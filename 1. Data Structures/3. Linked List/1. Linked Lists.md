# Linked Lists
- It is a **Data Structure** that aims to store items efficiently (insertion and removal operations)
- Arrays have a huge disadvantage
  - There may be **holes** in the data structure and we have to shift a lot of items
  - This problem can be eliminated by **Linked Lists**


| Data |
|----------|
| Reference |

- Every node stores the data itself and a **reference** the next node in the linked list data structure.
- This is why **Linked Lists** need more memory than arrays, but since these object can be scattered all over the memory, there is no need for shiting items.



## Characteristics
Items are not stored next to each other in the memory, hence **there is no random indexing**. We can also implement more complex data structures and abstract data types such as stacks and queues with Linked Lists.

**Advantages:**
- Manipulation of the first item takes **O(1)** running time.
- Linked Lists are dynamic data structures: they can acquire memory at run-time by inserting new nodes
- No need for resizing the data structures. It grows organically, hence it's not a problem if we do not know the size at compile-time
- Can store different sized items, arrays assume the items have the exact same size.


**Disadvantages:**
- Manipulation of arbitrary item takes **O(N)** running time.
- Need more memory because of the references.
- There is no random access.
