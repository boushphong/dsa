# Heap
## What is a Heap?
A Heap is a complete binary tree structure that satisfies the following properties:
- In a Min Heap, the value of each node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children.
- In a Max Heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

**Min Heap**
```python
      1
     / \
    3   2
   / \ / 
  4  6 5
```

**Max Heap**
```python
      6
     / \
    5   3
   / \ /
  4  2 1
