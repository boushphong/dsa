## Bubble Sort
The key idea behind bubble sort is to repeatedly compare adjacent elements in the input list and swap them if they are in the wrong order, with the ultimate goal of "bubbling up" the largest elements to the end of the list.

1. Start at the beginning of the list. (elements 0 and 1)
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements (elements 1 and 2) and repeat step 2.
4. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.
5. If any swaps were made in step 2-4, repeat the process from step 1 again. Otherwise, the list is sorted. At this step, The largest element is now at the end of the list. So we only need to sort the list 1 index less.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        swaps = False  # initialize a boolean flag to check if any swaps occurred
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swaps = True  # set the flag to True if a swap occurred
        
        # If no swaps occurred in the inner loop, the array is already sorted
        if not swaps:
            break
```

## Merge Sort
The key idea behind merge sort is to repeatedly divide the input list into halves until each sub-list contains only one element, which is trivially sorted. The sorted sub-lists are then merged back together using a helper function that compares the elements of each sub-list and selects the smaller element to add to the merged sub-list. This process is repeated recursively until the original list is reconstructed in sorted order

1. If the input list has only one element, it is already sorted, so return the list as is.
2. Otherwise, divide the input list into two halves and recursively sort each half using merge sort.
3. Merge the two sorted sub-lists back together in order to obtain a sorted sub-list. This is done by comparing the first elements of each sub-list and selecting the smaller element to add to the new merged sub-list. Repeat this process until all elements from both sub-lists have been added to the merged sub-list.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 recursively for each pair of sub-lists until the original list is reconstructed in sorted order.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    # If the input array has only one element or is empty, it is already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Otherwise, divide the input array into two halves and recursively sort each half
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    # Merge the sorted halves back together in order
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
        if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
            result.append(left_half[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right_half[j])
            j += 1

    result += left_half[i:]
    result += right_half[j:]

    return result
```
