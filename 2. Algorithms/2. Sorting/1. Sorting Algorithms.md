## Bubble Sort
1. Start at the beginning of the list. (elements 0 and 1)
2. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of adjacent elements (elements 1 and 2) and repeat step 2.
4. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.
5. If any swaps were made in step 2-4, repeat the process from step 1 again. Otherwise, the list is sorted. At this step, The largest element is now at the end of the list. So we can only need to sort the list 1 index less.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        swaps = False  # initialize a boolean flag to check if any swaps occurred
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swaps = True  # set the flag to True if a swap occurred
        
        # If no swaps occurred in the inner loop, the array is already sorted
        if not swaps:
            break
```
